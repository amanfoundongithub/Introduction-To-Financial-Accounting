Organization

Each chapter of this book is organized as a folder, with exercises, problems (and some critical thinking questions) added as sub-folders. The solutions are all generated as PDF files for ease of display. All solutions pertain to the question's number .pdf file. For example, solution to Chapter 3, question 30 is in `03-30.pdf`.
